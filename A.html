<h2>What is a computer virus?</h2><br><br>
A computer virus is a program or piece of code that infiltrates your computer without your knowledge or permission. Some viruses are only annoying, but most viruses are destructive and designed to infect and take control of vulnerable systems. A virus can spread between computers and networks by copying itself, much like a biological virus passes from person to person.<br>

<h2>Where do computer viruses come from?</h2><br><br>
Viruses are usually hidden in commonly used programs such as games or PDF viewers, or you may receive an infected file in an email attachment or along with another file downloaded from the Internet. As soon as you interact with the file (launch the program, click on the attachment or open the file), the virus will launch automatically. The code can then copy itself to other files and make changes to your computer.<br>

<h2>How to recognize a virus?</h2><br><br>
Your internet connection may be slow or may even stop working. Common behavior is also disabling the antivirus or firewall. Computers infected with viruses are even able to operate on their own, performing activities without your knowledge.<br>
